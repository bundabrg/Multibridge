## What is it

This provides dynamic backend servers for minecraft running under bungeecord
and can start and stop them on demand.

Warning: This was my very first Java project and thus may contain many repressed horrors so use
your own risk.

I am hoping to create a newer and better version called `MyServer` but have no ETA on it at the moment.
